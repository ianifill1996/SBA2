# 🌐 Accessible & Responsive Web Design

This project is a fully responsive and accessible website built with a focus on inclusivity and usability. It applies modern HTML and CSS practices to ensure compatibility across devices and full accessibility for users with disabilities.

## ✅ Key Features

### 🧱 Semantic HTML Structure
- Utilizes elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` for meaningful page hierarchy.
- Enhances both SEO and screen reader compatibility.

### 📱 Responsive Layout
- Designed with **Flexbox** and **media queries** to adapt seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
- Ensures consistent layout and user experience across all screen sizes.

### 🎨 Visual Accessibility
- All color combinations meet **WCAG 2.1 AA** standards for contrast.
- Visual information is reinforced with text or icons—never color alone.

### 🗣️ Screen Reader & Keyboard Support
- Full navigation using keyboard (Tab, Enter, etc.) is supported.
- Uses appropriate ARIA roles and attributes where needed.
- Logical heading structure (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) guides assistive technology.

### 📝 Form Accessibility
- Every input is linked to a `<label>` for screen reader clarity.
- Related form controls are grouped using `<fieldset>` and `<legend>`.
- Placeholder text supplements, but does not replace, proper labels.
